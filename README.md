# Machine-Based Learning Solubility

Summer Research Project undertaken in Yale-NUS College. Worked on the miscibility and solubility of liquids

### Miscibility of 2 solvents

Used matplotlib in order to plot the miscibility map of one solvent against another (mainly dependent on variables like dielectric
constant and volume of molecule

### Solubility of 2 solvents 

Used rdkit in order to derive solubility of a liquid based on linear regression model
