# Prediction of Aqueous Solubility of Substances using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models

This repository is a part of the research project conducted by Prof. Zhuang Bilin from Yale-NUS. We go over the possibility of predicting Aqueous Solubility of Substances using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models.

## Models:

We go over three different models of increasing complexity here to show the gradual increase in accuracy.

1. Linear Regression:
    * This is probably the mosr basic Machine Learning model out there. It's working principle can easily be understood by beginners and that is the reason this model is popular.
    * This model is not very accurate with large and complex datasets. It uses a single algorithm.

2. XGBoost Regressor:
    * __XGBoost__ - Short for '__Extreme Gradient Boosting__' is a Gradient Boosting Algorithm
    * This is very big leap from the previous model. This algorithm is widely used and is one of the best performers in many Kaggle Competitions.
    * It includes hyperparameters to reduce overfitting and other issues.
    * If used correctly, you can get great accuracy.
    * Training time is also quick.
3. Neural Networks: 
    *
